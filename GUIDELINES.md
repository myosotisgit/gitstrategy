## Prototypes
No prototypes. Just make the app. Polish as you go. Don't depend on polish happening later.

## Stable code
Always maintain constantly shippable code.
It's incredibly important that your application can always be run by your team. 

## Prevent runtime errors 
Bulletproof your engine by providing defaults upon load failure.

## Simplify code 
Keep your code absolutely simple. Keep looking at your functions and figure out how you can simplify further.

## Tooling & libraries 
Great tools help make great applications. Spend as much time on (your own) tools as possible.

## Testing  
We are our own best testing team and should never allow anyone else to experience bugs or see the app crash. Don't waste others' time. Test thoroughly before checking in your code.

## Bugs? Fix!
As soon as you see a bug, you fix it. Do not continue on. If you don't fix your bugs your new code will be built on a buggy codebase and ensure an unstable foundation.

## Code what you know
Write your code for this application only - not for a future app. You're going to be writing new code later because you'll be smarter.

## Object 
Encapsulate functionality to ensure design consistency. This minimizes mistakes and saves design time.

## Communicate and share 
Try to code transparently. Tell your lead and peers exactly how you are going to solve your current task and get feedback and advice. Do not treat app programming like each coder is a black box. The project could go off the rails and cause delays.

## Code is poetry
Programming is a creative art form based in logic. Every programmer is different and will code differently. It's the output that matters.
